# TODO: Improvements to Dashboard Page

## Plan Breakdown and Steps

1. [x] Add a dashboard stats/overview section at the top (e.g., cards showing total deliveries, active orders, recent activity summary). This will be placed right after the navigation in the main content area.

2. [x] Enhance the hero section with subtle animations (e.g., fade-in on load) or improved gradients using Tailwind classes. Ensure smooth transitions for better visual appeal.

3. [x] Make services sections more interactive (e.g., add Next.js Link components to expandable sections or modals for more details on each service like Shippers, Carriers).

4. [x] Add a new section for recent activities or testimonials below the services sidebar. This could include a simple list or carousel of user testimonials or mock recent orders.

5. [x] Improve mobile responsiveness (e.g., adjust grid layouts for smaller screens, ensure navigation collapses properly) and add loading states (e.g., skeleton loaders for sections).

6. [x] Update src/app/globals.css if needed for custom animations or styles not covered by Tailwind.

7. [ ] Test the page: Run the dev server, check on different screen sizes, verify no console errors.

Followup: After all steps, verify the page renders correctly and suggest running `npm run dev` to view changes.
